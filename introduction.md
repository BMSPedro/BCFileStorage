File storage is an essential business process for companies from the very beginning. Keeping, securing, and sharing documents is essential for day-to-day coordination. In addition, laws require certain documents to be stored under specific rules.

The issue of document management is addressed in every ERP implementation, often with a requirement to link documentation to the corresponding ERP entities and answering a few questions. 

## Volume:
Some sectors, such as fashion, require the storage of heavy photos and design documents, and some industries require the storage of specific technical drawings and documents. In this context, the volume can be quite large.

# Accessibility â€“ availability:
Documents must be available and accessible quickly. A user must be able to find a document easily, and not have to wait a long time for files to open.

# Security and confidentiality:
Storage must be secure and only people with the necessary level of permission should be able to consult the documents.
### Compliance:
The law may in certain regions impose rules on file storage, location, time, access, integrity and modifications.
